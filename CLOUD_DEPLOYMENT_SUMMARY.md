```

### Option 2: Docker Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone and deploy
git clone https://github.com/mistry247/media-monitoring-agent.git
cd media-monitoring-agent
cp deployment/production.env .env
# Edit .env with your settings
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Option 3: Traditional Systemd Deployment
```bash
# For traditional Linux service deployment
sudo ./deployment/deploy.sh systemd
```
